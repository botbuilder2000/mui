A Momentum 4.2x WebUI

This is a Web-UI designed to be installed on the Momentum 4.2.28 MTA-ONLY release on CentOS 6.5.  Any other use may have unpredictable results.  Use at your own risk.  **THIS IS UNSUPPORTED CODE.  Feel free to contribute or replicate, but dont complain if it does not work, as I may not have time to fix it.
This is a Bash installer that adds packages, modifies configs and places the initial PHP placeholder.
